## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `customize`

Customize the tostr error and info messages to more user friendly ones

### `npm run build`

Fill in environment variables in the first few lines of the nav.jsx file.   
These will be your AWS cognito user pool, client id and identity pool if you are using one.
